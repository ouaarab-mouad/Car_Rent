# RentCar Project

This is a car rental application project. It consists of a backend API built with Laravel and a frontend application built with a modern JavaScript framework.

The goal of this project is to provide a platform where users can:
- Register and log in.
- View available cars for rent.
- Book cars for specific dates.
- (For administrators) Manage users, cars, and bookings.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

-   `backend/`: Contains the Laravel application for handling API requests, database interactions, authentication, and business logic.
-   `frontend/`: Contains the frontend application built with a JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue, Angular - *specify here which framework you are using*). It handles the user interface and interacts with the backend API.

## Technologies Used

*   **Backend:** Laravel (PHP Framework)
*   **Database:** (Specify your database, e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
*   **Frontend:** (Specify your JavaScript framework, e.g., React, Vue, Angular)
*   **Other:** (Add any other significant technologies or libraries used)
